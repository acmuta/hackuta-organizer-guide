# What is MLH?

Major League Hacking (MLH) is the official student hackathon league. Each year, they power over [200 weekend-long hackathons](http://mlh.io/events) that inspire innovation, cultivate communities and teach computer science skills to more than **65,000 students** around the world.&#x20;

MLH Member events get various benefits like:

* Mentorship and Support
* Templates and Tutorials
* **Preferred Vendors and Discounts**
* **Onsite Hackathon Support**
* Mini-Events
* Judging Support
* **Prizes**
* Software Lab

(You can see the full list [here](https://mlh.io/event-membership). )

To [apply](https://mlh.io/event-membership) to become an MLH member event, an application must be submitted _at least_ 3-4 months before the event. Usually HackUTA will get \*special\* due to its successful history. During the HackUTA 2022 planning process, we were able to secure membership less than 9 weeks before the event.
